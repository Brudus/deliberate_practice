# Deliberate Practice

## Motivation

I'm a big beliver that in order to learn a new programming topic, you have to practice it fully and systematically. You can't just read random blog posts each day to strive as an engineer. Growing as developer means over and over forcing you into very focused, deep, deliberate practice. 

This repository will, therefore, act as a reference for me to document my learnings. 

This will serve others and me in two ways:

1. It's a reference that can be revisited when needed.
1. It's a mixture of deliberate practice and the [Feynman technique](https://medium.com/taking-note/learning-from-the-feynman-technique-5373014ad230).

## What is deliberate practice?

Deliberate practice is a heavily discussed topic in the learning and high-performance literature. I was first introduced to the topic by the book *So Good They Can't Ignore You* by Cal Newport. Later, I also read about the topic in *Ultralearning* by Scott H. Young and *Peak* by Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool.

Deliberate practice can be best described with a quote from James Clear (author of *Atomic Habits*):

> Deliberate practice refers to a special type of practice that is purposeful and systematic. While regular practice might include mindless repetitions, deliberate practice requires focused attention and is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance.

Especially, Cal Newport illustrates that well by comparing his skills in playing the guitar with one of the best guitar players in the world. Both have roughly practiced the same amount of time. However, their skill level differs heavily. The professional guitar player just practiced differently. He was more focused and pushed himself harder.

My goal with this repository is to push myself harder and very deeply understand problems that I face on my day-job or in side projects.
